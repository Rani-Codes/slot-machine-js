# slot-machine-js

Created a javascript application to get more comfortable around DOM elements in js. Started off at first by doing a fully server-side game of slots but wanted to incorporate visuals which is why I ended up pivoting halfway through. This game doesn't have a coin system or a bet system because I found those to take away from topics of the project that I wanted to focus on. Overall I am happy with how this turned out.
